- [x] Entity normalization and alias tracking (Teams, Drivers, Circuits, Series)
  - [x] DriverAlias and TeamAlias database tables with EF Core migration
  - [x] SeriesAlias and CircuitAlias database tables with EF Core migration
  - [x] EntityResolver service with multi-strategy matching (driver number, slug, known alias, DB alias, fuzzy match)
  - [x] known_aliases.json config with F1 canonical names and historical aliases (drivers, teams, circuits, series)
  - [x] Repository updates for ID-first upsert logic to respect entity resolver decisions
  - [x] Comprehensive tests (33 entity resolver tests, 81 total Python tests passing)
- [x] Navigation header + IA refactor for multi-series + discovery (define primary nav model: Series → Season → Round → Session; add dedicated entry points for Discovery: Sessions / Drivers / Teams / Circuits; include a global search box (spoiler-safe result rendering + respects spoiler_mode), persistent user menu + spoiler mode toggle, and breadcrumbs for deep pages; ensure routes/URLs align with BLUEPRINT.md and are consistent across all discovery/detail pages; responsive + keyboard accessible)
- [x] Series hub pages + API endpoint(s) (top-level entry point; series overview, supported seasons, quick links into season browser; establishes URL + navigation conventions for multi-series)
  - [x] SeriesController with GET /series, GET /series/{slug}, GET /series/{slug}/seasons, GET /series/{slug}/seasons/{year}
  - [x] SeriesDtos with summary and detail types for series, seasons, rounds
  - [x] Frontend SeriesListPage and SeriesDetailPage wired to real API
  - [x] Frontend types and seriesService for API calls
  - [x] 19 integration tests for SeriesController

### 🚧 In Progress


### 📋 Up Next
- [ ] Season browser + season detail pages + API endpoint(s) (per-series; calendar/round list, filters by session type, progress indicators for "logged" vs "unlogged"; spoiler-safe aggregates only)
- [ ] Round (weekend) detail pages + API endpoint(s) (per season; sessions timeline, circuit context, spoiler-safe status/metadata; acts as the primary "choose what to log" screen)
- [ ] Session discovery + detail pages + API endpoint(s) (spoiler shield end-to-end; after this task users can browse sessions by series/season/round and view session details with results properly masked until logged)
- [ ] "Log a Race" flow (core feature, end-to-end; multi-step modal or dedicated page; select session, enter basic info (date, watched vs attended, car/team/driver driven, comments), submit log; post-log redirect to session detail with results revealed)
- [ ] Driver discovery + detail pages + API endpoint(s) (spoiler shield; profile, teams over time, seasons participated; includes tabular + statistical views)
- [ ] Team discovery + detail pages + API endpoint(s) (spoiler shield; overview, seasons participated, drivers roster over time; includes tabular + statistical views)
- [ ] Circuit discovery + detail pages + API endpoint(s) (spoiler-safe by default; circuit overview, location/map, sessions hosted by season/series, "Attended" venue aggregates when available; includes tabular + statistical views)
- [ ] Basic feed/home page with recent activity API endpoint(s) 
- [ ] Global search UI + API endpoint(s) (spoiler-safe results; respects spoiler mode; covers sessions, drivers, teams, circuits, users, logs)

## 📝 Notes

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Spoiler Shield is non-negotiable** - All UIs hide results by default
2. **Watched vs Attended** - Separate rating systems for broadcast and venue
3. **Free tier is generous** - Historical data never gated
4. **Excitement != Quality** - Separate ratings for "how exciting" vs "how good"

### Open Questions
- How to handle live session updates without spoilers?
- Should lists be collaborative by default?
- PaddockPass pricing strategy?

### External Dependencies
- OpenF1 API reliability
- Community contribution model for non-F1 series
- Legal considerations for historical data
